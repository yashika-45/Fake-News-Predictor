**FAKE NEWS PREDICTION**

A fake news detection model using logistic regression algorithm
This project leverages the use of built-in python libraries like pandas,numpy,sklearn,string,etc to develop a predictive model which tells whether a news article is true or fake.

**OVERVIEW**

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to detect fake news and distinguish between true and fake news.Main algorithm used is Logistic Regression along with Random Forest Classifier to check accuracy.

**DATASET**

Two types of datasets are used in this project: Fake news and True news.The datasets have been downloaded from Kaggle.

**DATA PREPROCESSING**

Before training and testing the model the data has been cleaned and preprocessed.The two datasets have been merged into a single dataset.
We have dropped the unneccessary columns from the dataset.

**MODEL ARCHITECTURE**

**Logitic Regression** - a widely used algorithm for binary classification tasks. Logistic regression is effective for this task due to its simplicity and interpretability.

Input - Numerical vectors which represents news text.

Output - Label indicating 'true' or 'false'


**EVALUATION**

The performance of the model is evaluated using the testing set. The following metrics are used to assess the model's accuracy and reliability:

Accuracy: The percentage of correctly classified news articles.
Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions.
