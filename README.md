# Fake-News-Predictor
A fake news detection model using logistic regression algorithm
This project leverages the use of built-in python libraries like pandas,numpy,sklearn,string,etc to develop a predictive model which tells whether a news article is true or fake.

OVERVIEW
This repository contains a machine learning model designed to detect fake news and distinguish between true and fake news.Main algorithm used is Logistic Regression along with Random Forest Classifier to check accuracy.

DATASET
Two types of datasets are used in this project: Fake news and True news.The datasets have been downloaded from Kaggle.

DATA PREPROCESING
Before training and testing the model the data has been cleaned and preprocessed.
